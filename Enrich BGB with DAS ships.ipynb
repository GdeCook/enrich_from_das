    "# Enriching data from BGB with ship IDs from DAS\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 0.2 (11 February 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gerhard de Kok*\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is an experiment to enrich the data from the Bookkeeper-General Batavia dataset (BGB) with links to the data in the Dutch-Asiatic Shipping dataset (DAS).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "BGB has as list of voyages with associated internal ship IDs. Some of the ships in BGB are also present in DAS, which only contains intercontinental voyages. If a voyage (between Europe and Asia) is present in both BGB and DAS, a connection is (usually) already made between the BGB ship ID and the DAS ship ID. For about 14,500 (mostly intra-Asiatic) voyages in BGB, such a connection is not present. However, many of the vessels used for these voyages are present with a separate ship ID in DAS. The challenge is to link BGB ship IDs to DAS ship IDs in such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The present script tries to resolve this issue in a rule-based manner. Basically, the rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each voyage in BGB, check if the ship already has an associated DAS ship ID from another voyage in the original BGB dataset (if so, use that)\n",
    "    1. This is not as straightforward as it should be: BGB ship IDs are not unique (different ships that share a name can still have the same BGB ID). I therefore also check if the DAS connection present in the BGB dataset falls within the time range mentioned below\n",
    "1. If not, fuzzy match the ship name with a list of ship names in DAS. Then check to see if the DAS ship was active in the same time period:\n",
    "    1. The active timerange of a DAS ship is defined as: (first mention of ship in DAS) until (last mention in DAS + 20 years)\n",
    "    1. If the BGB voyage took place inside that timerange, make the match\n",
    "\n",
    "Caveat: when multiple matches are possible, the script now only makes the first match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the script matched 9403 BGB voyages to 772 unique DAS ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further cleaning is probably necessary. "
