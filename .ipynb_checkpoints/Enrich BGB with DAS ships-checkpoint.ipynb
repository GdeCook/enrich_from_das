    "# Enriching data from BGB with ship IDs from DAS\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gerhard de Kok*\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is an experiment to enrich the data from the Bookkeeper-General Batavia dataset (BGB) with links to the data in the Dutch-Asiatic Shipping dataset (DAS).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "BGB has as list of voyages with associated internal ship IDs. Some of the ships in BGB are also present in DAS, which only contains intercontinental voyages. If a voyage (between Europe and Asia) is present in both BGB and DAS, a connection is (usually) already made between the BGB ship ID and the DAS ship ID. For about 14,500 voyages in BGB, such a connection is not present. Most of these voyages were intra-Asiatic and are (thus) not present in DAS. However, many of the ships used for these intra-Asiatic voyages are present in DAS. The challenge is to link BGB ship IDs to DAS ship IDs in such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The present script tries to resolve this issue in a rule-based manner. Basically, the rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> For each voyage in BGB, look up the name of the ship involved\n",
    "> See if a ship with a similar name is present in DAS\n",
    "> See if the DAS ship was active in the same period as the BGB voyage (currently defined as first mention in DAS + 20 years)\n",
    "> If so, provisionally link the BGB ship ID to the DAS ship ID\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the script matched 7264 BGB voyages to 752 unique DAS ships. Some of the results are problematic:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The rules mark 'Anna Catharina' and 'Susanna Catharina' as the same ship. This can be resolved by decreasing the sensitivity for fuzzy matching (for which difflib in the Python standard library is used)\n",
    "* For some very common ship names (Hoop), the results are not always correct\n",
    "\n",
    "Some rule-based solutions are possible. I will add a refinement of the rules in a further iteration of this script."
